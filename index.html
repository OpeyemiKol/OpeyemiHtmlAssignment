    <h2 id="WHY">WHY I JOINED THE PROGRAM</h2>
    <h3>Why i chose Frontend Engineering</h3>
    <p>
      Technology has always fascinated me because of how it connects people and
      makes life easier. I decided to join a frontend engineering program to
      learn how to build websites and apps that people can use and enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background in human anatomy taught me how different parts work together
      to form something amazing. I see web development the same way—bringing
      pieces like design, code, and structure together to create a great user
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also wanted to improve my freelancing skills and explore more job
      opportunities. Frontend engineering gives me the chance to learn tools
      like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I can take on bigger projects and work
      on ideas that help others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This program is a step toward my dream of becoming a skilled developer.
      I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and building something meaningful.
